# Minishell

Project by ubazzane and lodemetz

# About

Minishell is a simplified replica of bash, providing a small yet powerful shell environment for command execution. Throughout this project, we delved into the intricacies of processes, file descriptors and UNIX systems, gaining invaluable insights into system-level programming. By implementing basic shell functionalities such as tokenization, command parsing, execution, and shell environment management, we improved our skills in process handling, file descriptor manipulation, and system calls.
